# Behavioral-analysis-using-Drift-Diffusion-Models
-Modeled online purchasing Decision Reaction Times (RTs) using a simulated Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) on UCI dataset.
-Evaluated model fit using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, comparing empirical and simulated RTs to assess accuracy.
-Segmented data into ”familiar” and ”unfamiliar” product groups to derive behavioral insights by comparing empirical means/standard deviations and fitted DDM parameters.
-Documented model limitations and proposed future research, including hierarchical modeling and mixture DDMs, to address
complexities like heterogeneous drift rates and variable non-decision times.
